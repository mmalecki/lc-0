# `lc-0`
Launch Controller 0 - a simple switch-based model rocket launcher. When I say
simple, I mean it!

Continuity checking? Yeah, sure, I'll tell you I've heard about it.

Keyed arm switch? Sure, as if I had any keys laying around doing NOTHING.

I mean, frankly, the thing doesn't even have space for batteries in its enclosure.

On the other hand, its most complicated components is probably the LED diode
telling you the launcher is receiving power. (What, were you hoping for a switch?)

You can load a larger capacitor in there to fire a cluster of rockets with a 9 V
battery, and the 2 mm traces should withstand about anything.
